List.h contains the prototypes for the List ADT and is read in to List.c and Lex.c
List.c contains the implementation for the List ADT and the prototypes for List.h
Lex.c acts as the client for List ADT. It reads in a file and prints out the lines in sorted order.
ListClient.c was provided for us on the webpage and serves as a way to test our List.c
Makefile was provided for us on the webpage and makes an executable file.

Special Notes: My program works but I couldn't figure out the memory leaks. I know some of it was in my clear(L) method in List.c. But whatever I tried it would 
alleviate some of the leaks but then I'd end up with seg faults or other errors. I tried my hardest to figure out what was wrong but I just couldn't figure out how to 
solve the issues without getting seg faults so I just left one of the ways I tried to handle the memory leaks commented out in my clear method. I tried my best and 
put hours of effort into looking into the issue but came up short in the end. Thank you for reading my whereabouts!
