List.java: holds the List ADT from pa1 except now it is a list of objects rather than a list of ints and methods have been modified to accomadate for this change.

ListTest.java: was taken from ListClient.java example in pa1. Since I got a 100% in pa1 I felt there was no need to create my own ListTest.java especially since I got 
full credit for my list in pa1 and I immediately passed all the cases for list in the grading script. The purpose for ListTest.java was to test my list as I went along
creating it but since all I had to do was make simple changes in it I felt there was no need for this file. 

Matrix.java: holds the Matrix ADT that allows the client of the Matrix to perform mathematical operations on it efficiently since the Matrix is sparsed. The matrix 
holds an array of list adt's and stores entry objects into the lists. 

MatrixTest.java: was the tester for my Matrix ADT. I actually used this file as intended which was to test my matrix's methods along the way and see if my 
implementations worked or not. This was very helpful for me in keeping track in how my matrix was doing in terms if it worked or not. 

Sparse.java: reads in an input file and creates two matrices of the same size and inputs values into the matrices from the input file. Performs operations upon the 
matrices and outputs the results in an output file.

Makefile: creates executable jar file to run Sparse and compiles all java files in directory
